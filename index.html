                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>
                        Neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer, allows
                        for measuring the early endpoint, complete
                        pathologic response (pCR). The I-SPY 2 trial (identifier: NCT01042379) uses
                        pCR as primary outcome when screening for emerging
                        agents. This tool allows for early assessment of a
                        treatment's cost-effectiveness based on how much the
                        treatment improves the pCR rate.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Methods</h4>
                    <p>
                        We developed a Markov model for predicting
                        future life-years and costs. The model was based
                        on I-SPY 2 data, complemented by SEER data and
                        accounted for time-varying effects and cancer
                        subtypes. We attained state and subtype specific
                        costs from a systematic review of the
                        literature.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Visualisation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The plot shows a cost-effectiveness plane with the
                        differences in costs and life-years. The point
                        illustrates the differences between a treatment arm
                        and the control arm, given a difference in pCR rate,
                        a breast cancer subtype and a cost of the
                        intervention.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Predictions</h4>
                    <p>
                        <h5>ICER</h5>
                        <p>
                            Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER),
                            summarises the cost-effectiveness of an
                            intervention. The difference in cost is divided
                            through the difference in effect, here
                            expressed as US dollars per life-year.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Life-years gained</h5>
                        <p>
                            The effectiveness measure, presented as life-years
                            gained, which is defined as the predicted life-years
                            for the treatment arm minus the predicted life-years for the
                            control arm.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Costs</h5>
                        <p>
                            The cost difference is defined as the predicted
                            lifetime healthcare costs for treatment arm minus
                            the predicted lifetime healthcare costs for the
                            control arm.
                        </p>
                        <h5>CrI</h5>
                        <p>
                            To quantify the prediction uncertainty a
                            probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed and
                            the results were used to provide 95% credible
                            intervals (CrI).
                        </p>

                    <h4>Interactions</h4>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Difference in pCR rate</h5>
                        <p>
                            Difference in pCR rate between the treatment and
                            the control arm, i.e. if 60% of the women in the
                            treatment arm had a pCR and 20% of the women in
                            the control arm had a pCR the difference in pCR rate
                            would be 40%.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Cost of intervention</h5>
                        <p>
                            The costs associated with the intervention in the
                            treatment arm.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Willingness to pay per life-year</h5>
                        <p>
                            A threshold value, here expressed as US dollars
                            per life-year, below which a treament is deemed
                            cost-effective.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Breast cancer subtype</h5>
                        <p>
                            The predictions are specific to four combinations of
                            molecular subtypes in breast cancer, determined by hormone receptor status (HR) and
                            the status of human epidermal growth factor receptor
                            2 (HER2).
